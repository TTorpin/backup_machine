-- right now, we delete the old existing directories (beyond some
   cutoff) without checking whether the backup that wrote the
   remaining directories was successful.  So if we had a successful
   backup and then a string of failures, and then was successful
   again, we would delete the last successful backup.

-- we should check whether the directories we are requesting backups
   of are valid, if not, we should continue to the next directory.
   Now we abort with a failure.  While this is a failure, it is not as
   critical as the copy itself failing, so we should treat those
   differently.
